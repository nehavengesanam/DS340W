"I just got back from your class, so I decided that I should start to type this paper. I am very happy with my classes, even though I feel like they are going to be rather difficult this year, especially my Calculus class. I have a hard time understanding what my professor is saying. I end up have to go home and teach myself most of the information. Well that's enough about school. I just thought about my exgirlfriend. I have very strong emotions about her. I know that she was my first love. But I also am so mad at sometimes. We had talked about me going off to college and we knew that it probably would work about, so we decided that we would date other people. From my experience this really does work out. The first girl that I dated after her was a girl from my waiting job in New Braunfels. I decided that I should tell my exgirlfriend, whose name is Genie, about the girl. This was a very big mistake. Genie came to the restaurant where I worked and caused a big scene. But this isn't the only thing that makes me mad. Things are totally different now that we decided to see other people. We don't get along and we can't talk to each other. I think women need to just make up their mind. They all act like want this perfect gentlemen that does everything for them, but when the actually get that they don't know how to treat it. Usually the go to far and try to take advantage of it and then the guy starts to despise the girl. I don't really wish that things were back the way they were, I just wish that we could still get along. I really miss talking to her. She was a person that I could tell everything to and still feel comfortable about doing so. I am lucky though, because I have a sister that I am very close to. She also goes to UT and she has been a very big help with getting me settled in here in Austin. She only lives a couple of blocks away from me and she is there for me whenever I need anything, as I am for her. This is my freshman year and I am already dreaming that college would be over. It isn't that I don't enjoy Austin or College, it is just that I am tired of school. I wish that there could be a step in your life that you could just skip, but that is impossible. I would love to just be able to be settled in to a good paying job, but since that will never happen I am prepared to work now to enjoy the benefits later.",Human-written,0
"It is 9:35 and I am beginning my stream of consciousness writing assignment. I have been at The University of Texas for exactly one week today. The first night I got here was probably the most alone I have ever felt. My roommate is my best friend from the town where I came from, Pearland. My other best friend was visiting us also. I'm not sure why I felt that way, I was surrounded by two of the people I feel most comfortable around. I'm sure it had to do with being in a different town, sleeping in a different bed, etc. I'm sure I'll learn all about that in this class. I didn't realize I would miss my parents as much as I miss them. I'm an only child and I never really considered myself that close to them. Actually, I am very close to my mom about certain things. As I've gotten older sometimes she just feels like one of my friends. At any rate I really miss them. They didn't call that whole weekend, and I realize it was because my mom didn't want to bother me, but it kind of hurt my feelings. So, I called them. This is really going to help out my typing I can tell it's getting faster. It's 9:46 now. I think when I get through with this I'm going to go to my other friends from Pearland's room and watch a movie or something. It's so easy to not mean new people when you already have friends. There's about 25 people from my home town here. I've met new people in my classes and everything, but these are the people I spend all of my time with. We'll see what happens in the future. Before I left Pearland I had been dating a guy who's going to Sam Houston. We weren't that serious, but now I miss him a lot. We were talking about what we were going to do and I had just assumed we would break up because we would be far away but he didn't see it like that. He had like a list of reasons we should or shouldn't stay together. At any rate, I told him I had to experience new things in college, blah, blah, blah, and we basically decided to break up. It's 9:54 but I'll keep writing a little more. I liked this guy on and off for like a year. Well, now I really kind of regret not staying together because I miss him. He came down to Pearland the Wednesday before I left and we hung out. I called him a couple days ago and he didn't sound very happy to hear from me. Okay, well now I'm rambling, I guess now I'm going to have to move on. Oh well we'll see what happens. It's 10:00. This was kind of fun.",Human-written,0
"Not only was the server down but it has taken several minutes to upload, even when I am connected at 32000 bps. I'm also seemingly tired because I just got back from water polo practice and we did a lot of swimming today. I feel a sense of responsibility doing this assignment and the others so I can get  back to reading the text and doing other subjects. At this point I'm winding down the day to get ready for bed and this is the time to release all the stress and aches  and to clear my thoughts. The only thoughts the come to my mind are what I will put in this assignment after each word. I do feel a little amused because I am also having a conversation over the internet with a friend in Houston, so I am not totally out of it yet. I also have to arrange my classes for the next day so I can be prepared with my bag and books I guess. I also need to set my clock and get ready to wash up and finish this letter. But I guess this is all the time I have and I will be ending this right now   :-)",Human-written,0

"According to some people, elderly drivers should be required to reapply for their driving licenses because with age comes diminished vision, hearing, and reaction time. How do you feel about this issue? Explain what you think should be done and why     "",""  On one hand, some elderly drivers may have health conditions or medication side effects that can impair their vision, hearing, reaction time, or judgment12. These factors can increase the risk of being involved in a crash or injuring themselves or others. Reapplying for a license could help identify and address these issues and ensure that elderly drivers are fit to drive safely.  On the other hand, many elderly drivers are still capable and responsible drivers who value their independence and mobility1. Driving helps them stay connected to their family, friends, and community. Reapplying for a license could be seen as a form of age discrimination or an unnecessary burden. Moreover, some studies suggest that elderly drivers are not more dangerous than other age groups. For example, according to the BBC, drivers aged 75 and over make up 6% of all license holders but account for just 4.3% of all deaths and serious injuries3.  I think that a possible solution could be to have a periodic assessment of driving skills for all drivers, regardless of age. This could help ensure that everyone who drives on the road meets the same standards and criteria. It could also help drivers of any age improve their driving habits and learn new techniques or technologies. This way, no one would feel singled out or discriminated against based on their age alone.",AI-generated,1
"Medical researchers, cosmetic companies, and others often perform experiments on animals. Many people feel that experimentation on animals is wrong and should be stopped immediately because animals do feel pain, and there are other alternatives. How do you feel?

"Some people are actively involved in promoting and supporting a cause, such as the release of international political prisoners or protecting the environment. Is there a cause you actively support? Write an essay convincing readers to support that cause.                    "",""  Climate change is a global issue that affects everyone and everything on our planet. It’s caused by human activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes that release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. These gases trap heat from the sun and cause the Earth’s temperature to rise, leading to more frequent and severe weather events like hurricanes, droughts, and floods.  The consequences of climate change are far-reaching and devastating. They include rising sea levels that threaten coastal cities and island nations, loss of biodiversity as species struggle to adapt to changing conditions, and food and water shortages that could lead to conflict and displacement.  But there is hope. By taking action now to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and transition to clean energy sources like wind and solar power, we can slow down the effects of climate change and protect our planet for future generations.  There are many ways you can get involved in the fight against climate change. You can reduce your own carbon footprint by driving less, eating a plant-based diet, and using energy-efficient appliances. You can also support policies that promote clean energy and protect natural resources.  I hope this essay has convinced you of the importance of taking action on climate change. Together, we can make a difference!",AI-generated,1
