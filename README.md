DS340W Project: AI-Generated vs. Human-Written Text Detection

This repository contains code and resources for analyzing the detection of AI-generated vs. human-written text. The project explores how text length affects detection accuracy using various machine learning models.


Python Script: Load the DS340TESTING.py onto Jupyter Notebook.
Dataset: Upload the CSV file (340dataset.csv) to the same directory as the .py file.
Run the Code

Open Jupyter Notebook, load DS340TESTING.py, and run all cells.

The code will:

Load and preprocess the CSV file.

Apply the detection model.

Output performance metrics, including accuracy and AUROC scores.
